The Google Concurrency Library (GCL) is an attempt to export several
internal C++ Google concurrency libraries in a form that the C++
standard committee may accept for TR2.


cd to the directory into which you've checked out the Google
Concurrency Library, and run:

  $ make
  $ make test


`make clean` will take you back to a pristine checkout.
